Dream Housing Finance, a leading provider of home loans with a wide-reaching presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas, is aiming to revolutionize their loan eligibility process.
Customers currently apply for a home loan, after which the company manually validates their eligibility.
To enhance efficiency and deliver instant decisions, Dream Housing Finance seeks to automate this process in real-time using data provided in the online application. 
Key customer details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and more will be used to create a model that identifies customer segments eligible for loans.
This approach will enable the company to target the right customers more effectively, streamlining operations and improving customer experience.
